What are the types of XXE attacks?

There are various types of XXE attacks:

    Exploiting XXE to retrieve files, where an external entity is defined containing the contents of a file, and returned in the application's response.
    Exploiting XXE to perform SSRF attacks, where an external entity is defined based on a URL to a back-end system.
    Exploiting blind XXE exfiltrate data out-of-band, where sensitive data is transmitted from the application server to a system that the attacker controls.
    Exploiting blind XXE to retrieve data via error messages, where the attacker can trigger a parsing error message containing sensitive data.
